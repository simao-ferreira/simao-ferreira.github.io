This is a work in progress.

For now this page reflects, even if not in detail, my efforts to learn something bit about creating web content, jekyll, css and a lot of other small subjects that caught my eye... or mind to be more precise.

I am a software engineer, my education revolves mostly towards backend, mainly in object oriented languages like Java, Kotlin and some C++ and tools that envelop it. I have worked and toyed with several other languages from C to Python but most of my core work as been in Java.

When I am not coding I like to read, fiction the most of all, lately fantasy or science fiction seem to catch my attention the most. If you have some noteworthy books that you believe I must not miss let me know, I'll add them to my todo list, be warned though, is big! (:

Something else I enjoy a lot, is simply to walk, once I was a scout and from that time something stuck with me, the love for walking through mountains, valleys or cities and see the nature, raw or man made, unravel before my eyes.
